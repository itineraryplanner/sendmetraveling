I want to travel and see 10 specific sights that are spread throughout Idaho and Arizona. I plan to fly from Utah to Arizona using the Allegiant Airline, Get a rental car and stay in hotel rooms and eat out for 5 days while I am there. Once done, I will return the rental car and fly from Arizona to Idaho using the Allegiant Airline,, get a rental car and I will be there for 7 days, and stay in hotel rooms and eat out. After which I will drive the rental car back to Utah from Utah.

I want the app to do the following

Enter in dates and destinations I want to be at and by when I want to be at them.

I want to be able to select transportation methods that I want to use between each destination.

If my transportation method chosen is airfare, I want to have the cheapest option auto chosen for me - but I also want the ability to select a specific airline if I wanted to

If my transportation method chosen is rental car, I want the app the automatically determine how long I would need the car, the cheapest car option, with the option of upgrading the rental vehicle.

When I have multi-destination trips where I will need multiple rental vehicles, the app will know the correct dates and present each trip with its own itinerary for the rental car.

I want to be able to select how many hours a day I will be driving, what time in the morning I want to start traveling.

I want the app to autoplot gas station destinations that will have the cheapest fuel prices based on my rental cars provided MPG at points along my journey. On top of this, I also want the app to tell me how much to fill up my vehicle so I can make sure I only spend what I need to on gas to maintain maximum savings.

I want the app to find and autoplot restaurants along the journey and add them to the journey every 4-6 hours of traveling, ideally around the times when I need to refuel my vehicle.

I want the app to automatically find housing along the journey for each night while traveling (not while flying, or if I specifically select "Drive through the night" mode). The housing the app finds needs to be the most affordable option based on my filters/requests. The hotel may not have all amenities I request, but the cheapest one that has all specified amenities will be chosen. I also want the option to select a specific address in case I choose to sleep on a friends couch.

I want the entirety of the travel itinerary to be broken up day by day, and then broken up by each leg of the daily travel so that I can click on a link and that link will then open up google/apple maps and will have that particular leg of the itinerary loaded.

I want the app to know my location and dynamically update my map segment links so only the segments that I have yet to do show up as a clickable link.

As I complete specific segments of my itinerary, I would like those segments to be visible in my overview of the journey, but not visible in my current or present itinerary.

I want there to be an "update" feature that I can set up a text/email notification to automatically send to an individual(s) where I am on my trip with my contact information, rental car registration, and hotel/housing information. This could be based off of number of segments that I have completed, every time I check into a hotel room for the night, or as an emergency notice that I am in danger or in need of help, on top of all fo this, I also want an update message sent if I linger in a location for too long or if I have severely deviated in my planned itinerary.

It would be great if I could have a hosted webpage that is created when I create a new journey that would allow anyone with the site link and a secure code I create to see any pictures that I have taken since my journey has started, my GPS location, any text updates I send to the site, and a comment section that people can use to message me through the site that goes directly through the site to the app. This site should also include my reservation information for rental cars, hotels, flights, restaurants.

I would also like to be notified about nearby locations that are popular such as museums, monuments, vistas, and other public locations so that way I can dynamically add an excursion to these locations while on my journey. If I add an excursion to a popular place, I want the app to dynamically adjust my current and future trip segments for the day. I also want the app to send any update to my travel itinerary to my web site.

I want to have an option of providing my dates of travel and my budget and to have a getwaway planned for me for a fee. I would expect to have push updates sent to my phone after I am in a certain location for a specific period of time that will lead me to the next location or destination for my trip. Push notifications would be sent to me one by one as different excursions or activities are starting that is planned for me. The website for my journey would also be available for this package as well, but only information that you need will be visible/accessible - except for an emergency code that can be set up to be sent to a trusted person in case of emergency.

I would expect that I can involve multiple people in my journey via the initial set up phase of either type of journey (whether planned by me or a surprise journey)

Social sharing would be expected for all popular social media sites for pictures taken, site sharing, and other purposes

I want to be able to have multiple trips planned at a time and only have my site display my current trip or a countdown to my next trip, or the ability to look at a video presentation/powerpoint of any of my previous trips
